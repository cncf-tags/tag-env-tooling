# TAG ENV Tooling

This repository is part of the [CNCF Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group (TAG ENV)](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability) and is used for smaller technical projects. Instead of creating new repositories for each project we want to try, we bootstrap them into this repository first. This is to reduce clutter in the repositories and make it easier to start smaller projects without having to go through a major process each time. When another larger project is due, Project Code will move it to a new repository in the [cncf-tags](http://github.com/cncf-tags) GitHub organization.
